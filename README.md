#### Maximum Score After Splitting a String
 Input: s = "011101"
Output: 5 
Explanation: 
'All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3'
Example 2:

Input: s = "00111"
Output: 5
Explanation: When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5
Example 3:

Input: s = "1111"
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 500
The string s consists of characters '0' and '1' only.


###2.
#### Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#### You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#### You can return the answer in any order.

 

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 103
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
